# Support

Hey! This app is fully distributed for **free** with **free license**.
I'm doing it with **passion** in my **free time**.
Trying to keep it stable and bug free as long as I can.
However, would be nice if you could bring me some coffee,
so I can work longer on it :)

# Thanks

# Flatpak Usage

If you installed this app via flatpak, make sure your browser of choice have access to Quick Web Apps profiles directory. The default location for custom profiles is `~/.var/app/dev.heppen.webapps/data/quick-webapps/profiles`, so your browser of choice must have `read-write` permission to this directory. Some browser have full access to your `home` location, but otherwise, you need to set it manually.

For Mozilla Firefox, you can do this by running this command:

`flatpak override --filesystem=~/.var/app/dev.heppen.webapps/data/quick-webapps/profiles org.mozilla.firefox`

or if you have `user-wide` installation, add `--user` flag to command, like so:

`flatpak override --user --filesystem=~/.var/app/dev.heppen.webapps/data/quick-webapps/profiles org.mozilla.firefox`
